    "body": "We believe this property has tremendous potential. However, as you’re likely aware, today’s high-interest rate environment has made it increasingly difficult for both investors and retail buyers to make the numbers work. Conventional financing rarely produces positive cash flow at this price point, and many retail buyers struggle to qualify for loans on properties like this.\n\nThat’s why we’re presenting a seller-financed structure designed to deliver:<br>✓ ABOVE full-price offer<br>✓ Passive monthly income for your client<br>✓ Built-in safeguards for peace of mind\n\n<strong>Offer Summary:</strong><br><strong>Purchase Price:</strong> {{price}}<br><strong>Down Payment:</strong> {{down}} (your commission paid upfront)<br><strong>Monthly Payment (PITI):</strong> {{monthly}}<br><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> {{rate}}<br><strong>Amortization:</strong> {{amort}}<br><strong>Balloon Payment:</strong> {{balloon}}<br><strong>Monthly Taxes:</strong> {{taxes}}<br><strong>Monthly Insurance:</strong> {{insurance}}<br><strong>Close of Escrow:</strong> {{closeEscrow}}<br><strong>Earnest Money Deposit (EMD):</strong> {{emd}}\n\n<strong>Contingencies:</strong><br>- Clear Title<br>- Property Condition acceptable upon inspection<br>- Verification of Rental Income\n\n<strong>Buyer Safeguards – For Seller’s Peace of Mind:</strong><br>We will execute a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure at closing. If we ever miss two consecutive payments, your client can reclaim the property immediately—no court, no expense, no delay.\n\n<strong>Flexibility With Intention:</strong><br>Creative financing is a delicate balance. We’re happy to discuss small adjustments as long as the deal remains viable for both sides.",
